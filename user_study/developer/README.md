# README

This folder contains material and results of our user study with developers.

## Target population

We recruited 21 participants through Zoom interviews and  a widely-used user study platform Prolific. We set the recruitment criteria as (1) being more than 18 years old, (2) living in the United States, and (3) having Python development experiences.

## Materials

The interview materials are available at `./material_phase1.pdf` and `./material_phase2.pdf`. Consent form is available at `./consent_form.pdf`

## Results

Due to IRB restriction, we only include the coded interview at `./interview_result.xlsx`. It also contains the result of the SUS questionnaire.
